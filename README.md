# GAF Bot

##### About
A Discord bot written in Python using Discord.py. Originally created for some fun custom commands for the gaming community The Never Ending GAF, but since has been developed with multi-server support for all of it's functional (and useless) abilities.

### Noteable Features:
###### Custom automated role management interface
Got a channel locked behind a role? Fed up of being pestered 24/7 to give people the role so they can access the ultra secret Minecraft tips and tricks channel? Well me too (not really), so I made this. It features a custom menu interface for users, plus an easy way for admins to manage the roles.
###### Moderation Commands
Whilst GAF Bot is not a moderation focused bot, it has some basic features including
- Mass message deletion
- Muting
- Banning and kicking
###### Spotify Searching and Daily playlists
What it says on the tin, search Spotify straight from Discord. Also get the top playlist for the day, or a random playlist from the list
###### Some nice utility commands
Get someones avatar, basic information about them (Date they joined the server etc)

I run the bot with very little downtime, and you're free to invite it. If you really do want to host it yourself, it's an open source project, but I wrote it for myself and my friends, so it's poorly documented for anyone trying to set it up, because it's always me doing it.

# Contributors & Notes
- Vinlock for helping me get my original VPS up for this the very first time
- Rory, for teaching me to teach myself
- Mave, for shouting at me in broken English until I improved
- Laura, for shotuing at me in not broken English until I improved
- Avaren, for making that PR one time when I forgot to add the permissions checks to the ban command, didn't test, pushed to production and got in the car to go on holiday. Yeah, that was a fun day when everyone could ban anyone. Also for calling me an idiot, and pushing me to work on stuff

## Lot's of love, DiNitride xoxo
