# GAF Bot

##### About
A Discord bot written in Python using Discord.py. Originally created for some fun custom commands for the gaming community The Never Ending GAF, but since has been developed with multi-server support for all of it's tools.

### Features:
- Customisable prefix
- Per-guild enable/disable modules
- Logging system for when a user joins, leaves, gets bans or unbanned from a server
###### Rolestate System! Save users roles when they leave the server
Rolestate saves the users roles when they leave the guild so people do not have to have all their roles re-added upon joining again. it also prevents leaving and joining again to circumvent a mute.
###### Custom automated role management interface
Set a list of roles that users can select to give themselves via either straight commands or a custom role reaction menu. Allows users to select the roles they want from an interative page.
###### Invite Cop!
Prevent people from sending invites in channels unless you select a bypass
###### Moderation
- Kicking/Banning
- xBanning (Banning a user who is not in the server by ID)
- Message purging (With ability to limit to only purging one users messages)
- Set a mute role and mute and unmute via the bot
###### Spotify

###### Misc!

I run the bot with very little downtime, and you're free to invite it. If you really do want to host it yourself, it's an open source project, but I wrote it for myself and my friends, so it's poorly documented for anyone trying to set it up, because it's always me doing it.

# Contributors & Notes
- Vinlock for helping me get my original VPS up for this the very first time
- Rory, for teaching me to teach myself
- Mave, for shouting at me in broken English until I improved
- Laura, for shotuing at me in not broken English until I improved
- Avaren, for making that PR one time when I forgot to add the permissions checks to the ban command, didn't test, pushed to production and got in the car to go on holiday. Yeah, that was a fun day when everyone could ban anyone. Also for calling me an idiot, and pushing me to work on stuff

## Lot's of love, DiNitride xoxo
